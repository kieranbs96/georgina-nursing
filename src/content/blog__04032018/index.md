Whilst currently being on my penultimate placement of my training in a Paediatric Emergency Department, i have seen first-hand multiple cases daily of scarlet fever. At triage even before calling the patient in, they have been inputted to iCare with the tag presenting problem: rash or something similar. On examination we see that it is not petechial or non-blanching to rule out meningitis and similar severe infections, but as a student at the beginning of my placement I had not even heard of scarlet fever, not even at university.
My first impression was this rash is dry, it could be eczema so not contagious we should place them in the waiting area. Until my mentor placed them in isolation and explained whilst the rash is dry, it is widespread over the body and it has a sandpaper texture, they had a sore throat, patchy tongue and fever. The cheeks as shown on the right from NHS choices I thought could have been from teething, still confused she prompted that the child could have scarlet fever, an infection caused by Group- A Step (GAS).
With that said, they are isolated in the ED where possible but nurseries and schools colonise scarlet fever without even knowing. In addition, it is not just one strain of scarlet fever spreading nationally but there is four; emm 3 being the most prevalent, with also emm 12, emm 1 and emm 4[3]. The cause of the resurgence is debated in the selected article where predisposed host factors and immunity status are two of four postulates [3].
Scarlet Fever once diagnosed should be treated with Penicillin V and the child should be isolated for 24 hours, usually at home if clinically appropriate. The selected article highlighted a new change in school and nursery guidance for scarlet fever outbreaks, therefore an obvious discharge advice from my point of view would be to ask the parent to notify staff at the school of the diagnosis. As some schools may not be aware of how infectious scarlet fever is or of the child's diagnosis.
Reassurance to the parent also needs to take place, as whilst prophylactic antibiotics are needed to reduce the complications that may arise from the infection, ED is not usually the place to receive these. A GP, out of hours GP or SELDOC appointment is most likely more appropriate if the child is well in themselves and do not have any red flag symptoms. I have seen GP and SELDOC referrals to A and E for complications of scarlet fever and at this point presentation to ED is the most appropriate action.
