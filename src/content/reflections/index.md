### An event or experience in your professional practice

1. ###Parent complaining about another member of staff – maintaining professional

    1. **What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?**

       Upon my neonatal placement in my third year I was looking after a newly admitted patient. The mother of this patient approached me in confidence crying suggesting the nurse in charge (NIC) had been ‘horrible’ to her. I gave her a hug and took her to the breastfeeding room as the only room free. We discussed what happened and the NIC had suggested she should be more organised and in the future eat herself before breastfeeding so she doesn’t have to rush off and she can express any remaining milk already stimulated in the breasts. The patient was three days old and the mother had recalled the NIC saying I understand you are hormonal being day three postnatal this is the hormonal peak for mothers.

       From this I validated mum’s feelings and empathised her with her frustration of being told what to do and concluded through discussion that mum didn’t feel good enough for her child. I reassured mum that this was not the NICs’ intentions at all and perhaps her communication should have been a bit different to assert this. I spoke to the NIC in person who was not aware of her insensitivity and the NIC went and discussed what happened with the mother knowing how she interpreted their altercation earlier.

    2. **What did you learn from this?**

       I learnt that as a student I can still have professional conversations with staff about changing practice. As a student I can deal with emotional parents and de-escalate misunderstandings. I also learnt how communication led to a misunderstanding so easily.

    3. **How did you change or improve your practice as a result?**

       From this I will be careful with my own practice in how I phrase things so parents don’t feel like useless parents but I can communicate the knowledge I need to share and teach. Thinking before speaking whilst seems so obvious is something I have aimed to do more since starting my training. Instinctively there would be things I want to say to parents about their lifestyle, behaviour or choices but the appropriateness and tone of conversation needs to be correct to communicate an effective accurate message that is not misinterpreted.

    4. **How is this relevant to the Code<sup>[1]</sup> ?**

       7.1 use terms that people in your care, colleagues and the public can understand

       7.3 use a range of verbal and non-verbal communication methods, and consider cultural sensitivities, to better understand and respond to people’s personal and health needs Nursing and Midwifery Council

       7.4 check people’s understanding from time to time to keep misunderstanding or mistakes to a minimum, and

       7.5 be able to communicate clearly and effectively in English.

       8.2 maintain effective communication with colleagues

       24.1 never allow someone’s complaint to affect the care that is provided to them, and

       24.2 use all complaints as a form of feedback and an opportunity for reflection and learning to improve practice


2. ###Nasogastric (NG) feeding technique – making thorough checks and being prepared

    1. **What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?**

       At the start of my second year in training I was asked by my mentor to administer an NG feed to a patient I was unfamiliar with. It was 1700 hours and I had not had my lunch on a long day shift. I asked my mentor for details of the feed to which she said the bottle is there warmed up you just have to administer it. I aspirate the NG checked the pH and the nostril measurement. The nostril measurement was the same to the one documented when passed and pH was 4.0 therefore I commenced the feed. The parents asked if gaviscon was in the feed after 1ml had already been administered. I automatically stopped the feed apologiesd sincerely, and asked my mentor about the gaviscon to which we added the gaviscon to the feed and finished administering.

    2. **What did you learn from this?**
       Whilst a verbal handover of instructions delegated to me may seem clear, check what is documented as whilst the feed was ready, the additive of gaviscon was not which was very significant.
       My second learning point being that flagging to my mentor I had not had a break could have mitigated the mistake as my concentration was lagging most likely with my BM, therefore looking after myself is just as important to look after others.

    3. **How did you change or improve your practice as a result?**

       Since, I have never fed following verbal instructions, I have always clarified documentation and checked with the parents they do not have additives, like gaviscon, infacol or thickeners. Therefore, I have covered all bases, verbal with colleagues, documentation and with parents. I exercised an extent of duty of candour here by admitting that the gaviscon had not been added and escalated the situation open and honestly so no harm was caused. An incident form and reflection was completed afterwards.

       The system failures in my lack of supervision and poor communication on my mentors’ part were discussed to mitigate this happening to other students. Now I am more assertive with taking my breaks and remind anyone which contradicts my right to have a break that it effects my concentration and therefore patient safety.

    4. **How is this relevant to the Code <sup>[1]</sup> ?**

       14 Be open and candid with all service users about all aspects of care and treatment, including when any mistakes or harm have taken place

       19.1 take measures to reduce as far as possible, the likelihood of mistakes, near misses, harm and the effect of harm if it takes place

       19.2 take account of current evidence, knowledge and developments in reducing mistakes and the effect of them and the impact of human factors and system failures


3. ###Management of a febrile convulsion in ED

    1. **What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?**

       A parent ran through the major’s ED doors with her 16month old child in her arms crying. Upon examination the child was having a convulsion with left sided limbs convulsing and his left eye rolled back. The child had a temperature of 39.9.c and the doctors diagnosed him with having a febrile convulsion. The ED nurses and I prepared buccal midazolam and administered it. Within 1 minute of administration the child stopped seizing.

    2. **What did you learn from this?**

       This was the first active febrile seizure I have seen and learnt that typically they only have one episode less than 5 minutes per illness and is most common under 5years old.  The best method to mitigate febrile convulsions is to treat high temperatures above 38.5.c regardless of discomfort. Some evidence suggests antipyretics should not be used if the fever is the only clinical abnormality, ie with no tachypnoea or tachycardia, however once above 38.5.c and under the age of 5 the treatment of fever is vital.

    3. **How did you change or improve your practice as a result?**

       Monitoring fever patients in the ED has become more vigilant in the under 5 age group. Therefore, even after an antipyretic is administered the rechecking of pyretic children is important.

    4. **How is this relevant to the Code <sup>[1]</sup> ?**

       6.2 maintain the knowledge and skills you need for safe and effective practice.

       22.3 keep your knowledge and skills up to date, taking part in appropriate and regular learning and professional development activities that aim to maintain and develop your competence and improve your performance.
